	/// <summary>DOM operations only raise exceptions in "exceptional" circumstances, i.e., 
	/// when an operation is impossible to perform (either for logical reasons, 
	/// because data is lost, or because the implementation has become unstable). 
	/// In general, DOM methods return specific error values in ordinary 
	/// processing situations, such as out-of-bound errors when using 
	/// <code>NodeList</code>. 
	/// <p>Implementations should raise other exceptions under other circumstances. 
	/// For example, implementations should raise an implementation-dependent 
	/// exception if a <code>null</code> argument is passed. 
	/// <p>Some languages and object systems do not support the concept of 
	/// exceptions. For such systems, error conditions may be indicated using 
	/// native error reporting mechanisms. For some bindings, for example, 
	/// methods may return error codes similar to those listed in the 
	/// corresponding method descriptions.
	/// <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core Specification</a>.
