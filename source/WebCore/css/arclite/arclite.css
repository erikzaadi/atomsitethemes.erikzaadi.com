Hi there!

Thanks for downloading the Arclite template.


This file is in charge of how the template looks and feels.
In order to change anything, edit this file as explained in 
the comments below.


There are a lot of options for this 
template you can choose from.

For starters, the general layout is determined by:
*/

@import "style.css";
/* or

@import "style-imageless.css";

 Then we'll define the header:
*/


/* Or choose from:
@import "options/header-default.css";

@import "options/header-blue.css";
@import "options/header-field.css";
@import "options/header-fire.css";
@import "options/header-green.css";
@import "options/header-red.css";
@import "options/header-wall.css";
@import "options/header-wood.css";

Now for the content:

*/


/* Or choose from:

@import "options/content-default.css";
@import "options/content-grunge.css";
@import "options/content-white.css";

and finally the side bar:
*/


/* Or choose from:

@import "options/side-default.css";
@import "options/side-gray.css";
@import "options/side-green.css";
@import "options/side-blue.css";

You also have an option to change the sidebar
to be on the left side, by adding:

@import "options/leftsidebar.css";

Note: leftsidebar.css needs to be in addition 
to one of the 4 side bar options available


This last import is mandatory, it's some hot fixes 
to be more fitting to AtomSite and an import
of a referenced library..

@import "atomsite.css";
@import "jquery.fancybox-1.3.1.css";

Enjoy!
